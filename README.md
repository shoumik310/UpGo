# IOT Project App - UpGo

This app is a companion to our fall detector. It uses a MPU 6050 attached to a NODEMCU to detect when a person has fallen and uses Firebase Cloud Messaging to push a notification the app. The app locally stores all data which one would require if they had to go to a hospital. The App has authentication using Firebase to ensure that sensitive details are not accessed by unauthorised persons.
